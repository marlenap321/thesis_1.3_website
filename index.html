                        <h4>After the Civil War, there was a severe shortage of beef on the east coast. Realizing the immense profit that could be made by transporting cattle, Texas ranchers began cattle drives, moving their herds to Kansas to reach railways to be transported throughout the country. With these cattle drives occurring across the state, ‘cowtowns’ began to form in Kansas and also became profitable. The biggest cowtowns in Kansas during this time were Abilene, Wichita, and Dodge City. The Kansas City Stockyards were built in 1871 and quickly became a booming industry thanks to the cattle drive throughout the state. At its peak 16 different railroads converged in this area.  The Stockyards officially closed their doors in 1991, ending the cattle trade in Kansas City.  But in the early 2000s the land was sold and the area was used for new purposes, and a new era of the Stockyards was born. </h4>

Beer is the third most consumed beverage just behind water and tea. In Kansas, beer and beer culture are big part of life. There are about 47 craft breweries producing 47,000 barrels of craft beer per year. There are events ranging from casual tailgates to planned gatherings, such as beer festivals and craft brew tastings. Kansas has other ties to brewing as well. With roots in agriculture, many of the ingredients in beer can be grown locally. For this reason, Kansas is a state with the Amber Waves of Wheat.</h4>

                        <h4>Whether or not you call Kansas the Sunflower State, the Wheat State or the Breadbasket of America, Kansas food has always been innovative. From the time of a brand-new state with sunflowers, bison, honey and wheat; to the influx of diversity with ingredients all the way from Sweden, Thailand and anywhere in between, we have been transforming the food landscape, but as with any landscape we have dry spells as well. The settlers were able to draw their resources straight from the environment to create sustenance, but the modern food environment is not as accessible, which affects how Kansan interact with food. On this journey through time we will learn from the settlers, check out some local producers, check in to some local grocery stores, stop by some local restaurants, and take a serious look and Kansas’s food insecurities. </h4>
